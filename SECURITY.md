## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the Jolt TLA+ specification, please report it by emailing security@iohk.io.

**Do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

## Scope

This specification defines formal properties for the Jolt zkVM continuation protocol. Security issues in scope include:

- Missing invariants that should be checked
- Incorrect attack prevention claims
- Inconsistencies between prose specification and TLA+ spec
- Flaws in the mathematical model

## Response Timeline

We aim to respond to vulnerability reports within 72 hours and provide a fix within 30 days for confirmed issues.

## Attribution

Security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities will be credited in our CHANGELOG.md and release notes, unless they prefer to remain anonymous.
